Heart Attack Data Set Analysis & Prediction
This data set is about 14 features about 303 people. The last feature indicates if the person had a heart attack. By using this data, I will use SCIKITLearn and XGBoost in order to understand the importances of these features in terms of a probable heart attach, and also build a machine learning algorithm which will predict the probability of one's having a heart attack.

The data is retreived from Kaggle.
